So he pleads his friend, Chang-wook, a production designer, to go with him on a trip even though Changwook had already made plans with his girlfriend, Moonsook, a composer. Eventually Changwook brings his girlfriend along and they all go on a trip to the west coast to visit Shinduri Beach Resort, which is covered with cherry blossoms and a flowing mist. There, Joongrae makes advances on Changwook's girlfriend, Moonsook. Already a fan of his films, Moonsook doesn't hide her interest. So later, while avoiding Changwook's eyes, the two spend a heated night together. But the next day Joongrae's face is filled with anxiety as he proposes to go back to Seoul. He and Moonsook then part awkwardly.",

      "title": "After Work",
      "overview": "Kuwait’s constitution says that every person has the right to a job, so in some places 20 people are employed for one person’s job. In South Korea, they work so much that a policy has been introduced to turn off computers at the end of the day so that employees can’t work any more. In the US, they give up over 500 million holiday hours each year, while Amazon’s drivers are trying to form a union. Meanwhile, robots are poised to take over most jobs and put the rest of us out of work. Work is so crucial to our identity and what we spend our waking hours on that it is barely noticed anymore. A lot has happened since a group of Puritan priests invented the concept of work ethic in the 1600s, and in the 21st century the very concept of work is in many ways disintegrating. A perfect situation for a filmmaker like Swedish mastermind Erik Gandini, who travels the world to explore what the concept of work means today – if it means anything at all.",
